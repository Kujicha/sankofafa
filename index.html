            <h3>Importance of a Will</h3>
            <p>A will is a legal document that outlines your wishes for the distribution of your assets after your death. It ensures that your estate is handled according to your wishes and can help avoid disputes among family members.</p>

            <h3>What is a Trust?</h3>
            <p>A trust is a legal arrangement where one party (the grantor or settlor) transfers assets to another party (the trustee) to manage for the benefit of a third party (the beneficiary). It's a way to hold and manage assets for the benefit of others, often with specific instructions on how and when those assets are distributed.</p>
